# EXPENSE-TRACKER-USING-PYTHON

There are many people in India that live on a fixed income, and they find that towards the end of the month, they don't have sufficient money to meet their needs. While this issue can arise because of low salaries, it is due to poor money management skills. Expense Tracker, also known as Expense Manager and Money Manager, is a desktop application or software allowing users to record their money inflow and outflow accurately.

People tend to overspend without understanding, which can prove to be dreadful. We can keep track of our daily expenditures with the help of a daily expense tracker. By the end of the month, we will have a clear picture displaying the flow of money. This is among the best ways to get the expenses under management and bring some semblance of order to the finances.

# Prerequisites of the Project

There are some libraries and modules that we will need in the creation of the GUI Assistant Application in Python. These modules are briefly described as follows:

# Tkinter:The tkinter module will help us provide the Graphical User Interface (GUI) to the application.

# Tkcalendar:The tkcalendar module will help us to work with the drop-down calendar.

# SQLite: The sqlite module will allow us to connect the Python script to the SQL database.

# Datetime: The datetime module will allow to work with date and time.

Since Tkinter, Datetime, and SQLite come as preinstalled modules in Python, there is no need to install them manually. However, we only require installing the Tkcalendar module.

The tkcalendar module can be installed using the PIP installer by typing the following command in a command prompt or terminal.


# Building the Expense Tracker using Tkinter in Python


In order to build the Expense Tracker in Python, we will create an empty folder and name it "Expense Tracker". Within this folder, we will create a Python program file as "main.py", where we will write the entire code of the project.

We have divided the complete project code for creating the Expense Tracker in Python into several steps for better understanding. These steps are shown below:

# Step 1: Importing the necessary modules.

# Step 2: Creating the database and defining functions to manipulate the data.

# Step 3: Connecting to the database and creating the main window of the application.

# Step 4: Adding necessary widgets to the window and setting the event triggers.



# Creating the Database and Defining the necessary Functions

Now that we have imported all the necessary modules to the project, it is time to create the database and define various functions implementing different operations in the application. These functions include retrieving the data from the database and listing them in the table, viewing a record from the data table, resetting the entry fields, removing a selected record from the database, deleting all the records from the database, adding a new record to the database, updating the details of the pre-existing record in the database, and displaying the record details in text format.



# Code Explanation:


# a. Render: It returns the Httpresponse object and combines the template with the dictionary that is mentioned in it.

# b. HttpResponse: It displays a text response to the user.

# c. Redirect: It redirects the user to the specified url.

# d. Messages: It helps to store and display messages to the user on the screen.

# e. Authenticate: It verifies the user.

# f. User: This model handles authentication as well as authorization.

# g. Session: It helps the user to access only their data. Without sessions, every user’s data will be displayed to the user.

# h. Paginator: It is used to manage paginated data.

# i. datetime:It is used to get the current date and time.


# Improving the Expense Tracker

You can add search functionality to let users find specific expenses based on their description, amount, category, or date. You can add an option to sort and filter records. Localize the app to support different languages and currency formats.

You could also extend the app with support for notifications. Let the user set up alerts to prevent them from exceeding budget limits or highlight any unusual spending.


# The Tkinter, CSV, and Matplotlib Modules


To build this expense tracker, you’ll need the Tkinter, CSV, and Matplotlib modules.

Tkinter lets you create desktop applications. It offers a variety of widgets like buttons, labels, and text boxes that make it easy to develop apps.

The CSV module is a built-in Python library that provides functionality for reading and writing CSV (Comma-Separated Values) files.

With Matplotlib, you can build interactive visualizations such as graphs, plots, and charts. Using it with modules like OpenCV can help you master image enhancement techniques too.




# Requirements and Features


# 1. User Input: Allow users to input their daily expenses, including the amount spent and a brief
description.

# 2. Data Storage: Use appropriate data structures or file handling techniques to store and retrieve
expense data.

# 3. Expense Categories: Implement the ability for users to categorize their expenses (e.g., food,
transportation, entertainment).

# 4. Data Analysis: Provide users with the option to view summaries of their monthly expenses and
category-wise expenditure.

# 5. User Interface: Create a simple and intuitive user interface to interact with the Expense
Tracker.

# 6. Error Handling: Include error handling mechanisms to address potential issues during user
interaction.

# 7. Documentation: Provide clear documentation for your code, explaining the logic behind key
functions and overall program structure.
